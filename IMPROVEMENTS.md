# LifeOS Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future improvements for LifeOS. Each iteration of development should aim to address one or more of these points, replacing this list with the next set of planned improvements upon completion.

## Next Steps

1.  **Context-Aware Guidance:**
    *   Introduce a feature that provides context-aware suggestions based on the user's declared state, aimed at either boosting inspiration or protecting focus.
    *   This moves beyond simple task management to actively support the user's mental state.
    *   **In low-capacity states (`foggy`, `anxious`, `flat`):** Before presenting a task, the system could suggest a small, mood-lifting activity.
        *   Example: "Before you start on that report, maybe 5 minutes of your favorite music or some sunlight would help clear the fog?"
    *   **In high-capacity states (`driven`):** The system could suggest techniques to shield and maintain focus.
        *   Example: "You're in a driven state. Would you like to start a Pomodoro timer or enable time-blocking in your calendar to protect your flow?"
    *   This would be an optional, configurable feature, allowing users to tailor the suggestions to what works for them.
