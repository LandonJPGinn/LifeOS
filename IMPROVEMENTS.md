# LifeOS Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future improvements for LifeOS. Each iteration of development should aim to address one or more of these points, replacing this list with the next set of planned improvements upon completion.

## Next Steps

1.  **Real-World Integrations:**
    *   Implement integrations for popular task managers (e.g., Todoist, Asana, Notion) and calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).
    *   Create a plugin-based architecture to make it easy to add new integrations.

2.  **Enhanced State Declaration:**
    *   Develop a mobile widget for quick state declaration.
    *   Explore integrations with physical buttons (e.g., Flic, IoT buttons) for a screen-free experience.
    *   Integrate with wearable devices to automatically suggest capacity states based on biometric data (e.g., heart rate variability, sleep patterns).

3.  **Smarter Modulation:**
    *   Use machine learning to learn from a user's behavior and suggest more personalized daily plans.
    *   Allow for more granular control over task and calendar modulation rules.
    *   Introduce the concept of "energy levels" for tasks and events to provide a more accurate daily budget.

4.  **Notification Management:**
    *   Integrate with operating system focus modes (e.g., iOS/macOS Focus, Windows Focus Assist) to automatically silence notifications based on the current capacity state.
    *   Allow for fine-grained control over which notifications are allowed in each state.

5.  **User Interface:**
    *   Create a simple, clean user interface for visualizing the daily plan.
    *   Develop a dashboard for reviewing past capacity states and identifying patterns.
