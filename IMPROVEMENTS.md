# LifeOS Current Development Cycle

This document outlines the features and improvements being implemented in the current development cycle. Upon completion, this list will be updated to reflect the next set of planned improvements.

## Future Improvements

1.  **Enhanced State Declaration:**
    *   Develop a mobile widget for quick state declaration.
    *   Explore integrations with physical buttons (e.g., Flic, IoT buttons) for a screen-free experience.
    *   Integrate with wearable devices to automatically suggest capacity states based on biometric data (e.g., heart rate variability, sleep patterns).

2.  **Smarter Modulation:**
    *   Use machine learning to learn from a user's behavior and suggest more personalized daily plans.
    *   Allow for more granular control over task and calendar modulation rules.
    *   Introduce the concept of "energy levels" for tasks and events to provide a more accurate daily budget.

3.  **Notification Management:**
    *   Integrate with operating system focus modes (e.g., iOS/macOS Focus, Windows Focus Assist) to automatically silence notifications based on the current capacity state.
    *   Allow for fine-grained control over which notifications are allowed in each state.

4.  **User Interface:**
    *   Create a simple, clean user interface for visualizing the daily plan.
    *   Develop a dashboard for reviewing past capacity states and identifying patterns.

5.  **User Feedback and History:**
    *   Allow users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the modulated day.
    *   Create a simple history view to track capacity states and identify patterns over time.

6.  **New `focus` command:**
    *   Introduce a `focus` command to help users avoid distractions.
    *   This command would temporarily hide non-essential tasks and silence notifications for a user-defined period.
