# LifeOS Current Development Cycle

This document outlines the features and improvements being implemented in the current development cycle. Upon completion, this list will be updated to reflect the next set of planned improvements.

**Note on Moods/Modes:** The current set of moods and modes are now considered a locked feature and will not be extended. Future development will focus on improving the tool's core functionality and integrations.

## Future Improvements

1.  **Real-Time Syncing:**
    *   Implement real-time, bi-directional syncing with integrated services (Asana, Google Calendar, Obsidian).
    *   Ensure that changes made in either LifeOS or the external service are immediately reflected across all platforms.

2.  **Enhanced Task Management:**
    *   Introduce a simple task creation and management system directly within LifeOS.
    *   Allow users to add, edit, and complete tasks from the CLI.
    *   Add support for task prioritization and deadlines.

3.  **Smarter Scheduling:**
    *   Develop a more sophisticated scheduling algorithm that considers task priority, deadlines, and user energy levels.
    *   Allow users to set preferred work times and break schedules.
    *   Introduce a "focus mode" that blocks out dedicated time for deep work.

4.  **Expanded Integrations:**
    *   Explore integrations with other popular productivity tools (e.g., Todoist, Trello, Notion).
    *   Develop a plugin architecture to allow for community-contributed integrations.

5.  **Improved User Experience:**
    *   Enhance the CLI with more intuitive commands and a more visually appealing interface.
    *   Develop a simple GUI for users who prefer a visual interface.
    *   Improve the onboarding process to help new users get started quickly.
