# LifeOS Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future improvements for LifeOS. Each iteration of development should aim to address one or more of these points, replacing this list with the next set of planned improvements upon completion.

## Next Steps

1.  **"First Step" Guidance:**
    *   For visible tasks, especially in `foggy` or `anxious` states, introduce a feature that helps the user identify the absolute smallest possible first action.
    *   This is not about breaking down the whole task, but about reducing the friction of starting. Examples:
        *   Task: "Write report" -> First Step: "Open the document."
        *   Task: "Do laundry" -> First Step: "Walk to the laundry basket."
    *   This could be implemented as an optional, interactive prompt in the CLI or a dedicated field in the task data model. The goal is to make the initial step so simple it feels effortless, bypassing executive dysfunction.
